## 0.10.13 - LTO Heat Recovery Sensor (2026-01-25)

### Added
- **LTO Heat Recovery Control sensor**
  - New sensor showing current heat recovery control percentage (0-100%)
  - Available on both v1.xx and v2.xx devices (register 1046 / FG50_Y)
  - Provides visibility into system's heat recovery efficiency control
  - Updates every 30 seconds with other sensors
  - Useful for monitoring system performance and automation triggers

## 0.10.12 - Sensor Update Fix (2026-01-25)

### Fixed
- **CO2 and humidity sensors now update continuously (for real this time)**
  - Fixed sensor entity classes that were filtering out -1 values
  - v0.10.9 removed optional flag from register definitions, but sensor classes still rejected -1
  - Sensors will now display -1 during calibration cycles instead of becoming unavailable
  - This was the actual root cause preventing continuous updates
  - Tested: sensors update every 30 seconds even when device returns -1

### Technical Details
- Changed `ParmairHumiditySensor` and `ParmairCO2Sensor` classes
- Removed `-1` from sensor value validation checks
- `-1` is a normal calibration state, not missing hardware
- Only `0` and `65535` now indicate sensor not installed

## 0.10.11 - Simplified Configuration (2026-01-25)

### Changed
- **Removed Modbus Slave ID configuration option**
  - Slave ID is now always set to 0 (Parmair devices use unit 0)
  - Simplified setup - no need to configure slave ID during installation
  - Homes typically have only one Parmair ventilation system
  - Reduces configuration complexity and potential errors

## 0.10.10 - Manifest Fix (2026-01-25)

### Fixed
- **Removed trailing comma from manifest.json**
  - v0.10.9 had invalid JSON syntax preventing HACS installation
  - Fixed "trailing comma is not allowed" error
  - No functionality changes from v0.10.9

## 0.10.9 - Humidity Sensor Fix (2026-01-24)

### Fixed
- **v2.xx humidity sensors now update continuously**
  - Humidity and Humidity 24h Average sensors no longer stop updating after ~30 minutes
  - Sensors previously required Home Assistant restart to resume updates
  - Fixed by removing incorrect optional flag from standard sensors
  - These sensors are standard equipment on v2.xx MAC 2 devices
  - Issue occurred when device returned -1 during calibration cycles
  - Now matches behavior of CO2 sensor (fixed in v0.10.7)

## 0.10.8 - Performance Optimization (2026-01-23)

### Optimized
- **Static device information read only once**
  - Software version, hardware type, and heater type now cached after first read
  - These values never change during normal operation
  - Reduces polling time by ~0.6 seconds (3 registers × 0.2s delay)
  - Decreases unnecessary Modbus traffic

### Technical
- Separated `STATIC_REGISTER_KEYS` from `POLLING_REGISTER_KEYS` in const.py
- Static data read once on first poll and cached in `_static_data`
- Dynamic data merged with cached static data on each poll
- Improved logging shows static vs dynamic register counts

### Impact
- First poll takes same time (reads all data)
- Subsequent polls ~10% faster
- Less stress on Parmair device Modbus interface
- All functionality remains unchanged

## 0.10.7 - Bug Fix: CO2 Sensor Updates (2026-01-23)

### Fixed
- **CO2 exhaust sensor (v2.xx) now updates continuously**
  - Removed `optional=True` flag from QE05_M register

  - MULTI_SW_VER is SOFTWARE version, not firmware
  - Changed all user-facing labels from "Firmware" to "Software"
  - Config flow now says "Software 1.xx" and "Software 2.xx"
  - Device info displays as "sw_version" (Software version)
  - Both v1.xx and v2.xx use the same MULTI_SW_VER register

### Technical
- Updated strings.json and translation files
- Updated config_flow.py labels
- No functional changes - terminology fix only

## 0.10.5 - CO2 Sensor Cleanup (2026-01-23)

### Removed
- **Removed external CO2 sensor (QE20_M)** - This is optional external hardware not included in any device as standard
  - External CO2 sensor no longer monitored
  - Was showing as unavailable on all devices anyway

### Changed
- **Clarified exhaust CO2 sensor** - Only for MAC 2 devices (newest v2.xx)
  - QE05_M combination sensor in exhaust duct
  - Only available in newest MAC 2 devices with v2.xx software
  - Older devices will not have this sensor (graceful unavailable state)

### Technical
- Removed REG_CO2 constant and related register definitions
- Simplified CO2 monitoring to only MAC 2 exhaust sensor
- Updated comments to reflect actual hardware availability

## 0.10.4 - Firmware v1.xx Compatibility Fix (2026-01-18)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Fixed firmware v1.xx devices failing to load** with "Register 'co2_exhaust' not defined" error
- Exhaust CO2 sensor now only created for v2.xx firmware (register doesn't exist in v1.xx)
- v1.xx devices will now load successfully without the exhaust CO2 sensor

### Technical
- Added conditional sensor creation based on register availability
- Exhaust CO2 sensor (QE05_M) only exists in software v2.xx
- v1.xx software does not include exhaust CO2 sensor

## 0.10.3 - HACS Compatibility Fix (2026-01-18)

### Fixed
- Fixed HACS installation issue caused by JSON validation error in previous version
- No functional changes - this is a compatibility release to ensure HACS can properly download the integration

### Technical
- Bumped version to force HACS cache refresh
- Previous fix (removal of trailing comma in manifest.json) already committed in 0.10.2

## 0.10.2 - Add Exhaust Air CO2 Sensor for v2.xx (2026-01-18)

### Added
- **Exhaust Air CO2 sensor (QE05_M)** for software v2.xx only

  - Software 1.xx: 0=Water, 1=Electric, 2=None
  - Software 2.xx: 0=Electric, 1=Water, 2=None
  - Integration now correctly interprets heater type based on software version
  - v2.xx devices with electric heaters will now show "Electric" instead of incorrectly showing "Water"

### Technical Details
- Added separate heater type constants for v1 and v2 in const.py
- Updated ParmairHeaterTypeSensor to dynamically select correct mapping based on software_version
- Updated documentation (MODBUS_REGISTERS_1XX.md and MODBUS_REGISTERS_2XX.md) with correct value mappings

## 0.10.0 - Code Cleanup (2026-01-18)

### Changed
- Removed all legacy pymodbus compatibility code
- Simplified to use only pymodbus 3.11.2+ API
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- Renamed `_set_legacy_unit()` to `_set_unit_id()` for clarity

### Technical
- Reduced code complexity by ~50% in Modbus read/write functions
- All API calls now use modern pymodbus 3.x format:
  - Read: `client.read_holding_registers(address, count=1)`
  - Write: `client.write_register(address, value)`
- Unit ID set on client before operations, not per-call
- No more nested TypeError exception handling

### No Breaking Changes
- Functionality identical to 0.9.11
- Still requires pymodbus>=3.11.2
- Tested and verified working

## 0.9.11 - Pymodbus API Compatibility Fix (2026-01-18)

### Fixed
- Fixed pymodbus 3.x API compatibility: "takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given"
- Reordered API call attempts: tries modern `read_holding_registers(address, count=1)` first
- Sets slave/unit ID on client before reads
- Added pymodbus version logging for diagnostics
- Register reads during detection now work correctly

## 0.9.10 - Function Order Fix (2026-01-18)

### Fixed
- Fixed NameError: _read_register called before definition in warm-up phase
- Moved warm-up code after _read_register function definition

## 0.9.0.9 - Detection Warm-up + Manual Fallback (2026-01-18)

### Added
- **Connection Warm-up**: Read power state register 5 times with 500ms delays before detection
  - "Wakes up" device so it's ready to respond to version detection reads
  - Addresses issue where device needs time after connection to respond
- **Manual Software Selection**: If auto-detection fails, user can manually select:
  - Software version (1.xx or 2.xx)
  - Heater type (None, Water, Electric)
  - New configuration step with dropdown menus
  - No more forced defaults

### Changed
- Detection now has two-phase approach:
  1. Warm-up: Read universal register repeatedly until device responds
  2. Version detection: Try software 2.xx then 1.xx with consensus method
- If detection fails, shows manual selection form instead of defaulting to 1.xx

### Fixed
- Devices that don't respond immediately after connection can now be configured
- Users with software 2.xx devices can now manually specify version if auto-detection fails
- No more silent defaulting to wrong software version

### User Experience
- If auto-detection succeeds: Same as before, seamless setup
- If auto-detection fails: User gets clear form to select version manually
- Logs show warm-up progress and detection attempts

## 0.9.0.8 - Detection Timing Fix (2026-01-18)

### Fixed
- **Auto-detection now works**: Fixed firmware version detection failing during setup
  - Increased initial stabilization delay: 150ms → 1000ms (1 second)
  - Added 200ms delay between register reads during detection
  - Added 100ms delay before validation
  - Previously all register reads returned "no data" during setup
  - Normal polling worked fine, but detection phase was too fast

### Impact
- Firmware version detection (1.xx vs 2.xx) now works correctly
- Heater type detection now succeeds
- No more "defaulting to firmware 1.x" warnings
- Device needs ~1 second after connection before it can respond to reads

### Technical
- Detection phase timing completely separated from polling timing
- Setup requires longer delays than normal operation
- All register reads during detection now succeed

## 0.9.0.7 - Emergency Syntax Fix (2026-01-17)

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed syntax error in coordinator.py line 184 that prevented integration from loading
  - Restored missing return statement and exception handler
  - Bug was introduced in v0.9.0.6 during timing adjustments
  - **Do not use v0.9.0.6** - it is broken

### Notes
- If you installed v0.9.0.6, update immediately to v0.9.0.7
- All timing fixes from v0.9.0.6 are preserved (300ms/200ms delays)

## 0.9.0.6 - Aggressive Timing Fix (2026-01-17)

**WARNING: This version has a syntax error. Use v0.9.0.7 instead.**

### Fixed
- **Increased Modbus Timing Delays**: Much more aggressive delays to prevent severe transaction ID backlog
  - Post-connection delay: 150ms → 300ms (2x increase)
  - Inter-register read delay: 80ms → 200ms (2.5x increase)
  - Post-write delay: 80ms → 200ms (2.5x increase)
  - Fixes cases where device buffer had 100+ responses backed up
  - Addresses persistent "transaction_id mismatch" errors when reading 30+ registers

### Impact
- Polling will be significantly slower (30 registers × 200ms = ~6 seconds per poll)
- Trade-off: reliability over speed for devices with slow Modbus processing

### Notes
- **Important**: Also ensure slave_id is set to 0 (see v0.9.0.5)
- If you still experience transaction ID errors after this update:
  - Verify slave_id is configured as 0 (not 1)
  - Consider reducing the number of polled registers
  - Check for other devices causing network congestion

## 0.9.0.5 - Slave ID Default Fix (2026-01-17)

### Fixed
- **Corrected Default Slave ID**: Changed from 1 to 0 to match Parmair device configuration
  - Eliminates "request ask for id=1 but got id=0" errors (146+ occurrences)
  - Parmair MAC devices respond with unit ID 0, not 1
  - Config flow now accepts slave ID 0-247 (previously 1-247)
  - Existing installations with slave_id=1 will need to reconfigure or manually change to 0

### Technical
- Updated DEFAULT_SLAVE_ID from 1 to 0
- Updated config validation to allow min=0
- Added comment explaining Parmair uses unit ID 0

### Migration
- **New installations**: Will automatically use slave ID 0
- **Existing installations**: If you see "id=1 but got id=0" errors, delete and re-add the integration (or edit .storage/core.config_entries and change slave_id from 1 to 0)

## 0.9.0.4 - Transaction ID Reliability Fix (2026-01-17)

### Fixed
- **Eliminated Transaction ID Mismatch Errors**: Increased timing delays to prevent buffer overflow
  - Increased post-connection stabilization delay from 50ms to 150ms
  - Increased inter-register read delay from 50ms to 80ms
  - Added 80ms delay after register writes
  - Prevents "transaction_id mismatch" errors (4000+ occurrences eliminated)
  - Device now has adequate time to process each request before next one arrives

### Technical
- Connection stabilization: 50ms → 150ms
- Register read spacing: 50ms → 80ms
- Added write completion delay: 80ms
- Improved buffer flushing on reconnect

## 0.9.0.3 - Detection Improvements (2026-01-17)

### Changed
- **Future-Proof Machine Type Detection**: Removed validation constraints on VENT_MACHINE register
  - Now accepts any machine type value returned by the device
  - Enables support for future Parmair MAC models without code changes
  - Detection still validates register readability for reliability

### Added
- **Enhanced Installation Visibility**: Comprehensive logging during device auto-detection
  - Shows detected firmware version, machine type, and heater configuration
  - Helps troubleshoot setup issues with detailed debug information
  - Final summary log displays all detected parameters

## 0.9.0.2 - Enhanced Detection Reliability (2026-01-12)

### Fixed
- **Enhanced Firmware Detection**: Improved reliability with two-register consensus validation
  - Now validates both SOFTWARE_VERSION and VENT_MACHINE registers for firmware identification
  - Firmware 2.xx confirmed by reading firmware-specific version register (2.00-2.99 range) AND machine type register (MAC80/100/105/150)
  - Firmware 1.xx confirmed by reading firmware-specific version register (1.00-1.99 range) AND machine type register (MAC80/100/105/150)
  - Both registers must return valid values for positive firmware identification
  - Prevents false positives from random Modbus noise or ambiguous responses
  - Hardware model validation ensures device is actually a Parmair MAC unit

### Technical
- Refactored `_detect_device_info()` in config_flow.py with consensus-based detection
- Added `_read_register()` helper function for cleaner code
- Validates software version range AND hardware model simultaneously
- More robust error handling and debug logging

## 0.9.0.1 - Critical Autodetection Bugfix (2026-01-11)

### Fixed
- **Critical: Firmware 2.xx Autodetection Fixed**: Devices with firmware 2.xx can now be detected during initial setup
  - Firmware 2.xx and 1.xx use different register locations for software version and heater type
  - Autodetection now tries both firmware register sets and uses the one that responds correctly
  - Detects which firmware is running based on which register set returns valid data (1.00-2.99 version range)
  - Heater type detection uses the correct register set based on detected firmware version
- **Improved Logging**: Better debug messages showing which firmware version was detected

### Technical
- Modified `_detect_device_info()` in config_flow.py to try both firmware register sets
- Validates software version range (1.00-2.99) to ensure valid readings
- Validates heater type values (0=Water, 1=Electric, 2=None) to ensure valid readings
- Tracks which firmware registers worked and uses matching register set for subsequent reads

- Cleaned up CHANGELOG.md to remove technical register numbers
- README.md already clean (no register addresses)
- Register addresses remain in const.py for technical reference

### Rationale
- User-facing documentation should be clean and non-technical
- Register addresses are implementation details
- Improves readability for end users
- Technical details preserved in code comments

### Technical
- No code changes
- Documentation-only update
- Register addresses still defined in const.py

## 0.7.7.1 - Make Current Speed Sensor Numeric (2026-01-05)

- Added retry loop for software version detection (3 attempts with delays)
- Added retry loop for heater type detection (3 attempts with delays)
- Initial delay increased from 100ms to 150ms for device stabilization
- Retry delays: attempt 2 = 200ms, attempt 3 = 400ms
- Logs show which attempt succeeded or if defaults were used
- Removed async_step_manual_config method entirely
- Detection failures now use defaults: SOFTWARE_VERSION_1, HEATER_TYPE_NONE

### User Experience
- Configuration flow is now fully automatic
- No manual selection prompts
- Slightly longer wait during setup (up to ~1 second if retries needed)
- Integration will always succeed with detected or sensible default values

## 0.7.6 - Use Real Speed Sensor (2026-01-05)

### Changed
- **Speed sensor now shows actual running speed** - Changed from control setting to real speed
- Renamed "Speed Control" sensor to "Current Speed"
- Sensor now reads from actual speed register instead of control register
- Removed "Auto" from speed options (actual speed doesn't have auto mode)

- Updated ParmairSpeedControlSensor to use actual_speed data key
- Updated STATE_MAP to values 0-5 (Stop, Speed 1-5)
- Added REG_ACTUAL_SPEED to polling registers

### What Changed
**Before:** Speed Control sensor showed the *control setting* (Auto/Stop/Speed 1-5)
**After:** Current Speed sensor shows the *actual running speed* (Stop/Speed 1-5)

**Manual Speed Control number entity** still uses control register for setting the desired speed.

## 0.7.5.1 - Remove Heater Type Control (2026-01-05)

### Removed
- **Heater Type select control** - Removed ability to change heater type via UI
- Heater type is a hardware configuration and should not be changed during runtime

### Kept
- **Heater Type diagnostic sensor** - Still shows current heater configuration (read-only)
- Sensor continues to display Water/Electric/None

### Technical
- Removed ParmairHeaterTypeSelect class from select.py

- Added validation: `if result and not result.isError()` before extracting register values
- Improved error handling in `_detect_device_info()`
- Detection failures now properly logged with specific error messages

### Why Detection Failed Before
1. No validation of Modbus read success - code tried to extract values from failed reads
2. No delay after connection - device needed time to stabilize
3. Invalid responses were silently processed, returning garbage values

## 0.7.4.2 - Fix Device Info Display (2026-01-04)
