## 0.9.0.1 - Critical Autodetection Bugfix (2026-01-11)

### Fixed
- **Critical: Firmware 2.xx Autodetection Fixed**: Devices with firmware 2.xx can now be detected during initial setup
  - Software version register: firmware 2.xx uses address 1015, firmware 1.xx uses address 1018
  - Heater type register: firmware 2.xx uses address 1127, firmware 1.xx uses address 1240
  - Autodetection now tries both address sets and uses the one that responds correctly
  - Detects which firmware is running based on which address returns valid data (1.00-2.99 version range)
  - Heater type detection uses the correct address based on detected firmware version
- **Improved Logging**: Better debug messages showing which addresses are being tried and which firmware version was detected

### Technical
- Modified `_detect_device_info()` in config_flow.py to try both firmware address sets
- Validates software version range (1.00-2.99) to ensure valid readings
- Validates heater type values (0=Water, 1=Electric, 2=None) to ensure valid readings
- Tracks which firmware registers worked and uses matching addresses for subsequent reads

## 0.9.0 - Full Firmware 2.xx Support (2026-01-09)

### Added
- **Complete Firmware 2.xx Register Mappings**: Full support for Modbus specification 2.28

  - Control registers: UNIT_CONTROL_FO (1180), USERSTATECONTROL_FO (1181)
  - All temperature, humidity, CO2, and state sensors working
- **Automatic Firmware Detection**: Seamlessly switches between 1.xx and 2.xx register maps
  - Reads MULTI_SW_VER register to detect firmware version
  - Loads appropriate register map automatically
  - No user configuration needed
- **Version-Specific Register Maps**: Separate register definitions for each firmware family
  - `_build_registers_v1()`: Firmware 1.xx with standard addressing
  - `_build_registers_v2()`: Firmware 2.xx with +1000 offset
  - `get_registers_for_version()`: Dynamic register map selection

### Changed
- **Control Architecture**: Firmware 2.xx uses different control scheme
  - Power control: UNIT_CONTROL_FO instead of POWER_BTN_FI
  - State control: USERSTATECONTROL_FO instead of IV01_CONTROLSTATE_FO
  - All existing entities continue to work with both firmware versions
- **Address Calculation**: Implemented proper +1000 offset for firmware 2.xx
  - Example: Fresh air temp Register ID 20 → Address 1020 (v2.xx) vs 1020 (v1.xx)
  - Temperature setpoint Register ID 73 → Address 1073 (v2.xx)
  - All 70+ registers properly mapped with correct offsets

### Technical
- Added comprehensive register documentation (MODBUS_REGISTERS_2XX.md)
- Updated RegisterDefinition.register_id property to support address calculation
- Coordinator uses version-specific register maps from const.py
- All platforms (sensor, switch, number, button, select) work with both firmware versions

- Initial delay increased from 100ms to 150ms for device stabilization
- Retry delays: attempt 2 = 200ms, attempt 3 = 400ms
- Logs show which attempt succeeded or if defaults were used
- Removed async_step_manual_config method entirely
- Detection failures now use defaults: SOFTWARE_VERSION_1, HEATER_TYPE_NONE

### User Experience
- Configuration flow is now fully automatic
- No manual selection prompts
- Slightly longer wait during setup (up to ~1 second if retries needed)
- Integration will always succeed with detected or sensible default values

- New register definitions: REG_SUMMER_MODE, REG_TIME_PROGRAM_ENABLE, REG_HEATER_ENABLE

### Changed
- Updated HACS metadata with "number" and "switch" domains
- Updated platform list in __init__.py to include Platform.NUMBER and Platform.SWITCH

## 0.1.13 - Branding Update (2025-12-27)

### Changed
- Updated integration name from "Parmair Ventilation" to "Parmair MAC" to align with official product naming
- Updated all references in documentation and user-facing strings
- Added disclaimer about project independence from Parmair

## 0.1.12 - Address Calculation Fix (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed off-by-one error in all register addresses
- Register ID + 1000 = Address calculation corrected
- All addresses were off by 1, preventing proper communication

## 0.1.11 - Register Documentation & Sensor Fixes (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Handle 65535 (0xFFFF) value for CO2 and humidity sensors (indicates sensor not installed)
- Corrected VENT_MACHINE register address

### Changed
- Updated register documentation with official Parmair register IDs (TE01_M, TE10_M, etc.)
- All register definitions now use official IDs from Parmair documentation

## 0.1.10 - Register Address Fix (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed all Modbus register addresses to match actual device addressing
- Register addressing corrected to use proper +1000 offset formula
- This was the root cause preventing all sensor data from being read correctly
- Slave ID 0 should be used instead of default slave ID 1 for most devices

## 0.1.9 - Thread Safety & Auto-Detection (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Add threading lock to fix transaction ID mismatch errors causing sensor data loss.
- ModbusTcpClient is not thread-safe; now all Modbus operations are serialized with threading.Lock().
- Always create all sensor entities (show unavailable if data missing) instead of conditional creation.
- Improve diagnostic logging with failed register tracking and data key reporting.

### Added
- Automatic hardware model detection via VENT_MACHINE register (eliminates manual model selection).
- Enhanced logging showing which registers fail to read with addresses.

## 0.1.8 - Extended Legacy Compatibility (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Add `device_id` keyword argument as additional fallback layer in Modbus read/write methods, supporting extremely old pymodbus builds (pre-2.0 era).
- Improve compatibility chain: `unit` → `slave` → `device_id` → attribute assignment → positional arguments.
- Reference jormai/parmair implementation patterns for legacy client handling.

## 0.1.7 - Countless Legacy Clients (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Retry Modbus reads without a count parameter after assigning legacy attributes to support the oldest pymodbus variants.
- Accept primitive read responses when legacy clients do not expose a `registers` buffer.

## 0.1.6 - Legacy Attribute Fallback (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Assign the slave/unit id through client attributes before retrying Modbus calls so extremely old pymodbus clients work during setup and polling.
- Avoid calling `isError()` on result objects that do not expose the method, preventing AttributeError on legacy responses.

## 0.1.5 - Legacy Modbus Support (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Add positional Modbus read/write fallback so very old pymodbus clients lacking both `unit` and `slave` keywords still work during setup and runtime.

## 0.1.4 - Modbus Compatibility (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Restore compatibility with deployments running older pymodbus builds by falling back to the legacy `slave` keyword when `unit` is rejected during reads or writes.
- Prevent config flow connection tests from crashing with a `TypeError` when the Modbus client lacks `unit` support.

## 0.1.3 - Model-Aware Registers (2025-12-27)

### Added
- Register metadata definitions per hardware model with placeholder support for MAC150
- Config flow model selector to ensure correct register mapping on setup
- Extra diagnostics attributes exposing register ids, addresses, and model info on fan and sensors

### Changed
- Coordinator read/write logic now scales values using register definitions instead of hard-coded addresses

## 0.1.2 - Handler Compatibility (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Resolve "Invalid handler specified" by registering the config flow domain explicitly
- Refresh README and register map to drop classified documentation references

## 0.1.1 - Config Flow Fixes (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Allow Home Assistant OS 2025.12+ to reuse bundled `pymodbus>=3.11.2`
- Provide translations bundle required by 2025.12 config flow loader
- Register config flow handler correctly for Home Assistant 2025.12
