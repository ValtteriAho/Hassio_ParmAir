## System Information

This integration supports Parmair "My Air Control" systems:
- **Firmware 1.x**: Fully supported (Modbus spec 1.87)
- **Firmware 2.x**: Infrastructure ready (register mappings will be added when specification available)

## Installation

### HACS Installation (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click the 3 dots in the top right corner
3. Select "Custom repositories"
4. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/ValtteriAho/Hassio_Parmair`
5. Select category: "Integration"
6. Click "Add"
7. Find "Parmair MAC" in HACS and click "Download"
8. Restart Home Assistant
9. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration
10. Search for "Parmair MAC"
11. Enter your device's connection details:
    - IP Address
    - Port (default: 502)
    - Modbus Slave ID (default: 1)
    - Polling Interval (default: 30 seconds)
    - Name (optional)

Hardware model will be auto-detected from the device.

## Configuration

The integration is configured through the Home Assistant UI. You'll need:

- **IP Address**: The IP address of your Parmair device
- **Port**: The Modbus TCP port (typically 502)
- **Slave ID**: The Modbus slave ID of your device (typically 1)

The hardware model (MAC80/MAC100/MAC150) and firmware version (1.x/2.x) are automatically detected by reading the VENT_MACHINE and MULTI_SW_VER registers.

## Entities Created

### Fan Entity
- **parmair_mac**: Main control for the ventilation system
  - Presets: Away, Home, Boost
  - Speed control (percentage based on preset)

### Number Entities
- **Home Speed Preset**: Adjust fan speed for Home mode (0-4)
- **Away Speed Preset**: Adjust fan speed for Away mode (0-4)
- **Boost Setting**: Set boost fan speed level (2-4)
- **Exhaust Temperature Setpoint**: Target exhaust air temperature (18-26°C)
- **Supply Temperature Setpoint**: Target supply air temperature (15-25°C)

### Switch Entities
- **Summer Mode**: Enable/disable summer mode operation
- **Time Program Enable**: Enable/disable scheduled time programs
- **Heater Enable**: Enable/disable heating element

### Sensor Entities
- **Fresh Air Temperature**: Outdoor air temperature
- **Supply Air Temperature**: Air temperature being supplied to rooms
- **Exhaust Air Temperature**: Air temperature being extracted
- **Waste Air Temperature**: Air temperature being exhausted outside
- **Exhaust/Supply Temperature Setpoints**: Target temperatures
- **Control State**: Current operating mode (Stop, Away, Home, Boost, etc.)
- **Power State**: Power status (Off, Shutting Down, Starting, Running)
- **Home/Away State**: Whether system is in home or away mode (Home/Away)
- **Boost State**: Whether boost mode is active (On/Off)
- **Boost Timer**: Remaining boost time in minutes
- **Alarm Count**: Number of active alarms
- **Summary Alarm**: Overall alarm status

Optional sensors (if hardware is present):
- **Humidity**: Indoor humidity level
- **CO2**: Indoor CO2 concentration
- Entity attributes include the selected model plus register id, address, and scaling to aid troubleshooting

Diagnostic sensors:
- **Software Version**: Multi24 firmware application version (used for firmware family detection)
- **Firmware Family**: Automatically detected as 1.x or 2.x based on software version

## Modbus Registers

All register mappings are documented in `MODBUS_REGISTERS.md`. The integration uses:
- Holding registers (Function codes 03, 06, 16)
- int16 data type
- Temperature scaling factor of 10 (210 = 21.0°C)
- Register addresses offset by -1 from documentation IDs

## Development

This integration follows Home Assistant's development guidelines and uses:
- `pymodbus` (tested with 3.11.x bundled in Home Assistant 2025.12) for Modbus communication
- `DataUpdateCoordinator` for efficient data fetching (30-second polling)
- Config flow for user-friendly setup
- Proper error handling and retry logic

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify the IP address is correct and the device is on the same network
- Check that port 502 is not blocked by firewalls
- Confirm the Modbus slave ID matches your device configuration

### Missing Sensors
- Some sensors (humidity, CO2) only appear if the hardware is installed
- Check the device's Modbus configuration to ensure sensors are enabled

### 0.1.4
- Fix config flow connection tests against pymodbus builds that still require the `slave` keyword.
